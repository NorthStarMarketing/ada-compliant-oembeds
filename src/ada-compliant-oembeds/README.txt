A simple plugin that adds the required 'title' attribute to oEmbedded iFrames.

== Description ==

The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that iFrames have a title attribute explaining the content within the frame.

Currently, WordPress oEmbeds do not support this and this plugin fixes that issue. Once you download and activate this plugin,
all of your oEmbedded videos should have the correct attributes to satisfy ADA compliance.

Support for this plugin is not guaranteed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `ada-compliant-oembeds` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

OR

Download and Install through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
