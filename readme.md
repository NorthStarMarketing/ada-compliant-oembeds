# ADA Compliant oEmbeds #

The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that iFrames have a title attribute explaining the content within the frame.

Currently, WordPress oEmbeds do not support this and this plugin fixes that issue. Once you download and activate this plugin,
all of your oEmbedded videos should have the correct attributes to satisfy ADA compliance.

Support for this plugin is not guaranteed.
